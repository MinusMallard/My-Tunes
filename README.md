# My Tunes

My Tunes leverages the extensive and diverse music library available through the unofficial JioSaavn API. This powerful integration allows users to explore a wide array of music genres, from Bollywood hits and regional classics to international chart-toppers. By tapping into JioSaavn's rich database, My Tunes ensures that users have access to a vast selection of songs, catering to varied musical tastes.

The backbone of My Tunes' user interface and media handling capabilities is Jetpack Compose's Media3 library. This modern toolkit enables the creation of intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing user interfaces. With Media3, My Tunes delivers smooth media playback, efficient resource management, and an overall enhanced user experience.
